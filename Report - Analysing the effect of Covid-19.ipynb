On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a global health emergency. On March 11, 2020, it was declared a global pandemic. With the worldwide cases nearing 9 million and 450 thousand people already succumbing to the virus, it has become a big concern. As countries strive to deal with the economic impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for new evidence and research to improve our understanding of the economic crisis in affected countries and the appropriate policy responses."

The cases in particular locations of the United States of America would then be observed and it would be inferred if popular locations have reported more cases or not. Data from Covid free countries (Eg. New Zealand) would also be analysed to see how they went about with eliminating the spread of the virus. </h>"
